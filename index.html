        <h1 class="title">About Me</h1>
        <section class="section-container">
            <p>My name is Lissette Garcia, I am a 23 year old full time employee looking to improve my knowledge and gain skills every chance I get. I was introduced to coding by a few people closest to me and decided to try it for myself. I discovered I have an interest in coding once I sat down and really gave myself time to create a plan for my future. With coding I would be able to create my own websites, push my own business via marketing strategies and even offer my services to other like minded individuals who also have a shared passion for creating and promoting self made products.</p>
            
            <p>Being from Miami I find that i have an itch for creativity. My dream is to be able to incorporate my creativity into my career path, whether it be painting, writing or creating music, I want to be able to share my art with the world and this goes for coding as well. I would also love to help others by creating websites and apps for their own creative needs.</p>
